Hey Guys. So after a full weekend of working on this I've decided to turn it in as is. The front end is not complete. I allowed myself to get carried away with ambition on the back end. I decided for some reason to learn Koa which I've never used, and built out a full database with authentication. Very basic Authentication mind you, but I took what was supposed to be a small easy project and really made it much more complex then it needed to be, so for that I apologize. I think it's safe to say here lesson learned.

The API currently works, I've been using postman to make API calls, so I will list the routes if you want to have a look at them. The Front end is another matter, you are able to send messages if you navigate to new message, and the login system does work. You can also view messages that come in. vuex store has a property called activeConvo, when that variable is set to the phone number of your conversation(convo_id in the postgres db), it will display

I hope that CityGro still has an interest in me. If you hire me I may not be your most experienced developer, but I can assure you I will be your most driven. I will be completing this app, I have enjoyed it greatly so far, I just need a bit of extra time.
